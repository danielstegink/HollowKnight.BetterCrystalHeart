# Better Crystal Heart
This mod enhances Crystal Heart to be a viable attack in combat.

Crystal Heart's charging time is reduced when Sprintmaster, Dashmaster and Quick Focus are equipped.
This bonus is based on their notch costs, with the maximum bonus being a 44% reduction.

Crystal Heart now deals damage equal to a fraction of the enemy's max health.
This bonus is based on the player's max health, and is increased by 36% if Deep Focus is equipped.

So if a player has 9 Masks, a fully upgraded nail, and Sprintmaster, Dashmaster, Quick Focus and Deep Focus equipped,
Crystal Heart will take about 0.44 seconds to charge and will deal about 120 extra damage to
an enemy with 1000 health.

Additionally, both bonuses can be customized using the menu plugin.
The maximum value is 100%, doubling all bonuses to damage and charge time,
and the minimum value is -100%, negating all bonuses.
